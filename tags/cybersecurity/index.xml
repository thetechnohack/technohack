          &lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-hacking-&#34;&gt;What is Hacking ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacking refers to activities that seek to compromise digital devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and even entire networks. And while hacking might not always be for malicious purposes, nowadays most references to hacking, and hackers, characterize it/them as unlawful activity by cybercriminals—motivated by financial gain, protest, information gathering (spying), and even just for the “fun” of the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-social-engineering&#34;&gt;What is Social Engineering?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacking is typically technical in nature (like creating malvertising that deposits malware in a drive-by attack requiring no user interaction). But hackers can also use psychology to trick the user into clicking on a malicious attachment or providing personal data. These tactics are referred to as “social engineering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;different-type-of-hackershackings&#34;&gt;Different Type of Hackers/Hackings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-inswhite-hat-hackerins&#34;&gt;1. &lt;ins&gt;White Hat Hacker&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, we have the perfect type of hacker to break the stereotype. The white hat hacker is a good guy, as ironic as it may sound. White Hackers, white hat hackers or ethical hackers are the people who test existing internet infrastructures to research loopholes in the system. They create algorithms and perform multiple methodologies to break into systems, only to strengthen them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of this as a lockpick, who would work his way around locks, only to inform the owners of how to make the locks work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous white hat hackers have historically been pivotal in ensuring that large corporations maintain a strong network framework so that it is unbreakable against all other types of hacking. From being employees of the Government to being private consultants, white hackers help internet be a better and safer place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-insblack-hat-hackerins&#34;&gt;2. &lt;ins&gt;Black Hat Hacker&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, these are the bad guys. Black hat hackers are responsible for all that is wrong with hacking. These guys break into systems purely with negative intentions. From stealing credit card information, to altering public databases, a black hat hacker looks to gain fame or monetary benefits from exploiting the loopholes in internet frameworks. Famous black hat hackers have notoriously robbed banks and financial institutions of millions of dollars, and invaluable private data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-insgrey-hat-hackerins&#34;&gt;3. &lt;ins&gt;Grey Hat Hacker&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grey hat hacker usually has mixed intentions. As the color code implies, this hacker type does not have the good intentions of a white hat hacker, nor does he have the ill intentions of a black hacker. A grey hat would break into systems but never for his own benefit. Famous grey hat hackers have exploited systems only to make the information public, and to bring to limelight vast datasets of information that contains wrongdoings.&lt;/p&gt;
